## Summary 

Recommend4U is a web application that allows users to look up products for recommendations or to recommend products themselves. For example, if a user is looking to buy gamer headphones, they can make a request for "Gaming Headphones" and other users might comment "Turtle Beaches", "Recons", etc. The goal of Recommend4U is to make it easier for users to make decisions with the help of other users' experience and recommendations.
